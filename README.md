3) Design Principles:
   Proximity: 
             In my website, I utilized the principle of proximity by grouping books together based on their respective categories. This approach not only 
             enhances the organization of information but also makes it easier for users to navigate and find what they're looking for. By clustering 
             similar items together, the design promotes coherence and clarity, facilitating a smoother and more intuitive user experience.
   Contrast:
             In my website, I used different font size for different headings and content and created shapes for div to identify elements in the website 
             easily which results in improving overall readability in my webpage.
   Typography: 
             In my website, I have nested elements according to the hierarchy of contents. Also, by using deep blue background with white boxes for text 
             breaks up the design, provides the right level of contrast, and offers good readability.
   Alignment:
             In my website, all items are aligned together with some relation between them. No item or element is placed randomly and positioned in a way   
             like having no relation to surrounding elements.
   Repetition:
             In my website, certain patterns are repeated such as book container and colors to maintain uniformity and improve readibility. I used same 
             fonts throughout my entire webpages. In addition to this, more similar shaped items are kept together to maintain uniformity.
       These are the design principles considered in my website.
4) Website Accessibility Compliance:
             Usage of semantic HTML Tags: Using semantic HTML elements appropriately helps screen readers and other assistive technologies interpret and                  navigate the content more effectively.
             Alternative Text for Images: Providing descriptive alternative text (alt text) for images allows users who cannot see the images to understand               their content and purpose.
             Color Contrast: Using sufficient color contrast between text and background elements improves readability for users with visual impairments.
             Responsive Design: Designing websites to be responsive ensures that content is accessible across various devices and screen sizes,           
             accommodating users with different abilities and preferences.
       These are the strategies used by me to improve my website's accessibility.
5) Search Engine Optimization Strategies:
             Keywords: Included meta keywords for my webpage to identify easily by webcrawlers for relevant searches or content.
             Description: Provided a description for my website for internet users to identify what contents are in the webpoage.
             Robots: added "all" as an option in Robots for indexing my webpage in search results in web browsers.
     These are the strategies used by me to improve search engine optimization.
